This project will be a web page to monitor temperature of RabsperryPI 5. There is Raspbian OS running on that machine.

# goal
Goal is to provide HTML page showing historical data for CPU, GPU, SSD temperatures plus temperature from external sensor if available. 

This project should be written in Python and use standard Python libraries available for RaspberryPI.

Page should show also historical data where user could select the time range to show. 

# configuration
Application should be configurable by config file where user should be able to set
- how often the data are collected (from 1 minute to 1 hour)
- from which sensors data to collect and show
- if external sensor to be used

# structure
Code should be separated to folders based on the usage
- code which is execuded periodically should be in one folder called `collector`
- code which will be part of the web page or web server should be in folder called `server`
- additional scripts, like bash scripts should be in folder `scripts`.
