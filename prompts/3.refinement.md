# adjustments
Let's do few adjustments in the code.

## exteral sensors
External sensors reading should be done by modules. If user wants to read by e.g. DH11 sensor, module for this sensor should be loaded and used. If ds18b20 sensor, then corresponding module will be used. 
So the configuration file should have bit different structure. First there should be list of user defined sensors with names like `ds18b20` or `dh11`. Then for each of this defined structure user have to define file which allow the reading. These files, more procisely `plugins` should be stored in `collector/plugins` subfolder. Configuration also should have variable part which is necessary for every sensor. Name of the sensor should be stored alongside with the data in the DB and then shown on web page.

# SSD readings
Although configuration file allow to configure more devices to read temperature from, the web page have only one card and one line for SSD. It should at best show as many SSD/NVME devices as they are configured in config.json. At best it should also show their name, like in our example, device name is `Lexar SSD NM710 1TB`. This name should be stored alongside with data in DB and then showed on the web page as user can change devices, but historical data should be preserved for old device.

# data cleaning
Let's also create script which wipes out all stored data in the database.
